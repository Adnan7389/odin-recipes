    <h2>How to Rotisserie a Chicken</h2>
    <p>
      You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief
      overview of what you can expect when you make this rotisserie chicken:
    </p>
    <p>
      Season the chicken cavity with salt and place it on a rotisserie (tie the
      wings and legs if you have twine or string available). Set the grill on
      high and cook for 10 minutes. Turn the grill down to medium and baste with
      a mixture of the butter and the seasonings. Close the lid and continue
      cooking, basting occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through. The
      internal temperature should reach at least 180 degrees F.

    <h2>How to Cut Rotisserie Chicken</h2>
    <p>
      Allow the chicken to cool for about 15 minutes before carving. To carve:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a cutting board.</li>
      <li>
        Pull one of the legs away from the body and slice through the meat until
        the hip bone is exposed. Then, pull the leg harder until the leg is
        detached.
      </li>
      <li>Use your knife to separate the drumstick and thigh.</li>
      <li>
        Pull the wing tip away from the breast until you can easily cut through
        the joint.
      </li>
      <li>
