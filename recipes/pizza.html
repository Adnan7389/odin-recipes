    <h1>Easy Homemade Pizza Dough</h1>
    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water(110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1(.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C),
        and lightly grease a pizza pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until
        creamy, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You
        can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to
        make it easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a
        12-inch circle.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
      <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove
        from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ul>
